        On 2 September 2020, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Government of India banned PUBG
        Mobile along with 117 Chinese applications stating that the apps were engaged in activities which were
        prejudicial and threat to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the state and public
        order under Section 69A of the Information Technology Act.

        In November 2020, it was reported that PUBG Mobile was going to be relaunched in India, named as PUBG Mobile
        India. On 24 November 2020, a news published on The Times of India reported that PUBG Corporation (renamed
        PUBG Studios) and South Koreaâ€™s video game company Krafton Inc. have registered PUBG India Private Limited
        under Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India to relaunch PUBG Mobile in India.

            data regarding users' Android device was being sent to Tencent-owned China servers."The one reason
            behind this could be because of PUBG Mobile account transfer feature that Krafton is allowing BGMI players
            to transfer their account and game data from PUBG Mobile to BGMI till December 2021," reported The Times of
            India.
